/*

In Kotlin, everything is an object in the sense that we can call member functions and properties
on any variable. Some types can have a special internal representation - for example, numbers,
 characters and booleans can be represented as primitive values at runtime - but to the user they
 look like ordinary classes. In this section we describe the basic types used in Kotlin: numbers,
  booleans, characters, strings, and arrays.
